# ⚡🌐 Web Workflow — Smart Charging Station Owner Dashboard

An **AI-powered web dashboard** designed for **EV Charging Station Owners** to monitor, control, and optimize charging operations in real time.  
The system balances **grid load, charging priorities, energy costs, and revenue**, while giving owners **full transparency and manual control**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This web application provides a **centralized control panel** for EV charging stations where owners can:

- Monitor live charging activity
- View AI-driven optimization decisions
- Manage grid load and energy usage
- Control charging priorities manually
- Track revenue and AI-based cost savings

The goal is to **maximize efficiency, reduce peak-load penalties, and increase profitability** using real-time AI optimization.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 📊 1. Live Dashboard (Overview)
A real-time snapshot of the entire charging station:

- Total EVs connected
- Chargers in use vs available
- Current grid load
- Power consumption
- AI optimization status

This allows owners to instantly understand station health.

---

### 🚨 2. AI Alerts & Notifications
Smart alerts generated by the AI engine, such as:

- “Grid load high — slowing non-urgent charging.”
- “Low electricity price — boosting charging speeds.”
- “Charger #3 is underperforming.”

These alerts enable **fast decision-making** and proactive management.

---

### 🔌 3. Charging Sessions Management
A detailed view of all active charging sessions.

**Table View Example:**

| EV ID | Charger | Battery % | Target % | Departure Time | Priority | Status |
|-----|--------|----------|---------|---------------|----------|--------|

Owners can click any EV to:
- View detailed charging info
- Adjust charging priority
- Control charging power

---

### 🤖 4. Real-Time AI Optimization Logs
Complete transparency into AI decisions, such as:

- “EV 12 slowed due to high grid load.”
- “EV 7 upgraded to high priority (leaving in 20 min).”
- “Switching to solar-only mode for 12 minutes.”

This builds **trust in AI behavior**.

---

### 🎛️ 5. Manual Control & Overrides
While AI handles optimization, owners always stay in control:

- Change EV priority (Low → High)
- Boost or reduce charging power
- Pause charging for specific EVs
- Turn AI ON/OFF per charger

Perfect balance between **automation and human control**.

---

### ⚡ 6. Energy & Grid Load Monitoring
Live and predictive grid insights:

- Current load vs allowed load
- Predicted load (next 1 hour)
- AI load-balancing actions
- Real-time interactive charts

Helps prevent transformer overloads and penalty charges.

---

### 💰 7. Revenue & Cost Savings Dashboard
A business-focused analytics page showing:

- Charging revenue
- Energy costs
- AI-driven cost savings
- Peak-hour avoidance savings
- Solar / renewable energy usage 
## 🔄 Real-Time Usage Scenario

**Time: 6:00 PM (Peak Hours)**

- Owner logs in → Dashboard shows **High Load Warning**
- AI slows low-priority EVs to protect the transformer
- Owner sees:
  > “EV 3 slowed — departure at 10 PM, no urgency”

**Customer Request:**
- Customer needs to leave early
- Owner increases priority for EV 7
- AI safely boosts EV 7 charging speed

**Later at 8:00 PM:**
- Electricity tariff drops
- AI alert:
  > “Low tariff detected — maximizing charging for all EVs”

Owner checks updated **revenue & savings reports**.

---
